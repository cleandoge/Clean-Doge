## EnergyWeb Chain can Save Doge from causing an Environmental Disaster

Energy Web is accelerating a low-carbon, customer-centric electricity system by enabling any energy asset owned by any customer to participate in any energy market.

To do so, they have developed and deployed an open-source decentralized technology—the EnergyWeb Chain—with a global community of more than 100 energy market participants. EnergyWeb Chain is a “Proof of Authority” (PoA) blockchain where real power companies like Shell, Vodafone and others are validating the blocks. this is different to Dogecoin which achieves consensus through Proof of Work (PoW) similar to Bitcoin, Ethereum, Litecoin and other Proof of Work chains. The primary difference between the two models is the amount of trust. In the PoW model, trust is limited. Miners are free to join and leave at will, knowing that they can be certain that the longest chain is the “true” chain. To maintain this trust-minimised system, large incentives must be paid to the miners in terms of fees and block reward subsidies. This makes most PoW systems extremely expensive to operate in reality (for example, sending $100 USD of Eth on the Ethereum network cost this author $120 in gas fees at the “average” price level). In PoA systems, validators like Shell, Vodafone and others, confirm the blocks. This trust enables much faster block times and transaction confirmations and fees are insignificant.

## CleanDoge is written for and runs on the EnergyWeb Chain.


# Clean Doge. Earth We Save Moon We Go. WOW!
## DogeCoin – Not as friendly as it looks

Dogecoin is merge-mined with Litecoin. This is because Dogecoin was a fork of Litecoin – it uses the same hashing algorithm to gain Nakamoto consensus in the Proof of Work as Litecoin – “Scrypt”. Consequently, any miners set up for Dogecoin almost always mine litecoin (and visa versa). The power consumed by the combined miners is not as high as the Bitcoin network, but is still a huge amount of energy for a joke to live on. Litecoin/Dogecoin mining was consuming about the same energy as Cambodia or Moldova in 2018. It is probably significantly higher now, given the rapid influx of new investors. For a joke coin, this fun loving doge sure has created a lot of CO2, oceanic acidification and catastrophic climate change.

We aim to make an environmentally friendly version of dogecoin, running on EnergyWeb Chain


The primary location to buy Clean Doge, or COGE, will be Carbonswap, an EnergyWeb Chain clone of Uniswap

# Tokenomics

Total Supply: 21 million COGE, to be released at genesis. With each transaction, 1% of the supply will be burned, 1% will be redistributed to all token holders, and 1% will go to a liquidity fund that will be permanently locked.

Prior to the tokens release, an audit of the code will be undertaken to ensure it does not contain any errors

We are a small community of environmentalists with a vision of a decentralised future. Please join us in making memes and spreading the word of COGE.

Before the release of COGE, some amount will be distributed to the members whom have contributed. The details are yet to be estimated, but in total will be less than 0.1% of the total supply.
